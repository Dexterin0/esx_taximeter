# esx_taximeter
updated and shortened version of the Taximeter hud from 57 modified by Dexter

If you want to change the key setting open client/main.lua and search for 170.
Replace it with one of those controls : https://docs.fivem.net/game-references/controls/

With my version its limited to the taxi job, you can add another if line if you want more jobs, I can do some examples later
